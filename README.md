# IffUtils

Wanted a decent IFF viewer for my Mac, but the only options were:
  * paying for a crappy app that was slow and didn't support 24bit images
  * using something heavyweight like Gimp with a plugin

Secondly, at the time I was quite interested in learning Swift; so decided to write my own viewer.
This is my attempt at that, it works fine, but the Swift code is probably not ideal/perfect.
